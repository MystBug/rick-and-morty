# What is this?

This is a simple React application that fetches data from the [Rick And Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) API using GraphQL.

On the initial page you will find a search bar and a list of top 10 episodes with the highest count of unique characters' origin dimensions.

When you search for a character, the application will display a list of results found based on the searchTerm. This list will display the character's name, image, and a link to the characters' detail page.
